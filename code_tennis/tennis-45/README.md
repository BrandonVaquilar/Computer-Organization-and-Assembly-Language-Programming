Code tennis assignment for CSCI-45

### Objective
+ One person creates C++ code modifying an array that they compile into an archive (`.a`) file.
+ They then pass the archive file to Partner B whose task is to write ARM32 assembly to figure out what Partner A did to the array.
+ This occurs twice before both Partners write a short essay on what they think the other Partner did.
+ During this project, neither Partner observes one another's code.
